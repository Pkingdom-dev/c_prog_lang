I just finished learning Instructions and Operators in C.

I came to realise that we have different types of instruction in C such as:

* Type Declaration Instructions.
* Arithmetic Instructions.
* Control instructions.

 I also learnt that in C programming the Operators are:
 
 *  "+", "-", "/" and "%"
 * Note the "^" does not mean raise to power in C but it means bitwise operator.
 * For we to use to raise to power either we;
 * mutilply the value twice or make use of "pow(x,y)" by introducing the "math.h" library

Fron the knwoledge gained I will be peforming a task:

* By writing a C program to check whether a number is divisible by 97 through the user input.
